       "\"I have friends with the same degree as me, from a worse school, but because of who they knew or when they happened to graduate, they’re in much better jobs,” said Kyle Bishop, 23, a 2009 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh who has spent the last two years waiting tables, delivering beer, working at a bookstore and entering data. “It’s more about luck than anything else.” \\n It's not  just  about luck, Kyle.  It's also about networking, experience and professionalism. \\n This is why you should, if you have the opportunity, enrol in a co-op program.  I graduated with 2 full years of real-world work experience in my field and had a job lined up before I graduated.  In fact, I still don't technically have my degree because I was a lazy student and had to take some part time courses while I worked full time.  But that hasn't stopped me from already being hired for two jobs that pay 65k+ during the tail end of a recession.  At the end of the day they hire me because I can prove my effectiveness as an employee, not just as a student. \\n Granted my experience comes from an in-demand field.  But when I compare myself to others who have taken more schooling in the same field but without coop, I'm WAY more marketable.\""
