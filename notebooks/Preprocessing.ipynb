Having started LoL at the start of S1, I quickly started to main Anivia and I am, to this day, lacking the Team Spirit skin for her. \\nI do however own several other Limited Edition skins from Harrowing and other events. And I say this is not a compromise in any sense. \\nLimited means limited. If Riot puts them up for sale again they lose all value and importance. They are so amazing primarily because they are not available to 90%~ of people playing the game today. \\nWould you really be so in awe of Kitty Kat Katarina if you saw every single Kat player using that skin? I think not. \\nRiot needs to stop trying to please all the new players begging for legacy content and start to honor the old players that have been investing in the game from the very beginning.', \"I got some technical issues with my computer who crashed several times lately and randomly, and I ended being leave busted. \\n Problem is, I've been suggested to visit this link to fix technical issues. A suspicious link according to my computer. \\n This is a screenshot : \\n Can any Rioter explain this ? I thought the Riot support domain was\", 'Firstly, I want to reiterate what has been stated multiple times in light of this news - the level of berating criticism is too high in this subreddit.  Doublelift put it succintly [here,]( starting from about 7:55 in the video. \\n Second, I want to address the comparison that is often drawn between e-sports and \\'classic\\' sports.  People frequently use this comparison from either side of the argument regarding social media and its effect on players. \\n The argument/counter-argument goes something like: \\n \\n Regular athletes have to deal with fan-hate too \\n Yeah but regular athletes aren\\'t nearly as active on social media (and they don\\'t stream) \\n \\n I think that the comparison to sports is valid and helpful, since e-sports is growing and \\'classic\\' sports offer examples for what direction e-sports should head in the future. \\n What is important is being aware of all the many differences existent in the realm of e-sports.  Most pertinent of these differences: \\n 1.  A much higher level of player involvement in team decisions \\n Coaches and Managers are a recent addition to many LCS teams.  In any other sport, there are issues that will affect players (such as trade rumours), but it is much easier to tune out because they are able to focus solely on playing the game, while Management handles trade talks etc.  With League of Legends, in many cases the team has been together longer than they have had Managers/Coaches/Analysts.  While the decision to remove/trade/find another player lies with those in management roles, they must consider the effect that will have on the rest of the team and may seek out the opinion of the rest of the team before taking any action (see Reggie consulting with his team-mates before replacing Chaox) \\n 2.  Replacing a player is much more of an \\'all-in\\' move in e-sports \\n Any other sport has subs that can be inserted  during  games.  If an incoming player joins a team and is unfamiliar with the plays the team is running, they can be eased in, playing limited minutes until they\\'ve had a chance to mesh with a team.  For an LCS team, an incoming player would have to have a vastly superior individual skillset to the player they replaced in order to immediately improve the team.  If a player is removed from a team, (no matter if they are the \\'weak link\\') team synergy is immediately reduced.  There are only 5 players on the rift, and it takes time to develop communication and trust within that 5-man squad. \\n 3.  The window of \\'in their prime\\' is  much  shorter in e-sports than any other sport and the window for providing \\'veteran leadership\\' is equally short \\n I\\'ll look at basketball here because it is my most familiar sport. In the NBA, a long career would be 20 years.  In that time, a star player would likely remain key to their team\\'s success (a \\'Franchise Player\\') from the time their skills develop to star level (e.g. 3rd year in the league) to about 30 years old.  From then, they have many options: stay with the same team while younger talent begins to receive more focus, move to another team and provide wisdom to younger players that haven\\'t been in the league for as long, bounce from team to team in search of a championship while taking a pay cut. \\n In League, you\\'re in from 17 (age of eligibility) and your mechanical skills are considered in decline by the time you\\'re maybe 22, and you\\'re probably going to retire once you\\'re 25 (depending on the role - i.e. Jungle/Support less mechanically intense).  Veteran leadership is provided by stepping down from the starter role and becoming a coach/analyst (see: Reggie, Scarra?, Saint) \\n 4.  Retirement is a new thing for e-sports and teams and players navigating these challenges are breaking new ground \\n Yes, the game has been around long enough that many players have already retired, but the era of LCS and comparisons to \\'classic\\' sports is relatively new. \\n As the previous points demonstrate, it can be difficult for a player to know when to retire.  From a team perspective, the rest of the team may be happy with a player that is \\'getting the job done\\' in their lane because what is lacking in mechanical skill is made up for by team synergy.  So, if the team is still happy with a player, it makes it difficult for team management to ask a player to step down in favour of younger blood since that goes against the team\\'s wishes.  Same for individual decisions to retire - it may be in that player\\'s best interest to step down, but still may come as a shock to the team. \\n \\n Let\\'s bring this all back to Nien.  Again, I\\'ll say that the criticism is too harsh.  I don\\'t think that point is even arguable any more. When a player states that hate from social media factored into his decision to step down, then the community has gone too far.  You can say they should suck it up, and that athletes deal with the same thing on a regular basis all you want, but dealing with hateful criticism isn\\'t part of a League player\\'s job.  A way to combat this would for teams to use social media to tweet out positive responses to negative performances -  \"We\\'ll get \\'em next time!\" type tweets.  As much as Forgiven has been crucified on this subreddit, he really shouldn\\'t have trashed his team after a loss; doing so reinforces the types of trashing comments that come from the community. \\n Maybe Nien would have decided to step down regardless of influence from the community - he seems like he\\'s driven to get better and doesn\\'t want to negatively impact his team.  Still, stepping down or retiring should be something that players can decide to do with dignity.  They are contributing to something that we consume for entertainment - and, I should note one more difference, they are being paid a pittance when compared to professional athletes.', \"ARAU - All Random All Urf \\n You log onto league after updating a patch. When you get in game you notice a new game mode on your list, its called ARAU. You have no clue what it is. \\n You que up for ARAU, and you still have no idea whats about to happen. You see the ready check pop up, you click ready. You get into champ select and see that you are on the twisted treeline map playing hexakill. You then notice everyones champs have been picked for them as if it was aram. You then proceed into game and notice you have 0 mana costs and 80% cd. You then proceed to have a lot of fun. \\n You liked ARAU so you decide to que up again. This time when you get into champ select, it says the game mode is DoomBots. And again you notice all of your champions have been randomly assigned yet again. When you get into game you notice you have 0% mana costs and 80%Cdr. And again it was the most fun you've had playing league in a long time.\", 'RE your second argument: the modified smites (and their items) could be considered flexible enough that they can be used by the ADC to decent effect because of their diversity and flexibility.  Smite isn\\'t just for instantly gaining that level 2; the new items that support dueling and ganking can work for ADCs as well as junglers. \\n Step 1: ADC builds Skirmishers or Stalkers for the champion smite.  Skirmisher\\'s smite reduces smote enemy\\'s damage and deals on-hit bonus true damage.  Stalker\\'s smite slows and deals true damage.\\nStep 2: ADC builds Warrior for AD/CDR/Armor Pen OR Devourer for AS and on-hit magic damage that scales twice as hard on champion kills and assists as it does jungle monsters.\\nStep 3: ???\\nStep 4: Profit. \\n Example: Imagine Vayne or Twitch running Devourer Skirmisher\\'s early/mid game, or Lucian with a Warrior Stalker.  I\\'m not going to defend its gold-efficiency because it\\'s probably really terrible compared to following \"the meta\", but in theory the two items and the two enchantments do provide all the right kinds of stats for ADCs.  Whether or not the stats actually grant the return on their worth, I have no idea; I\\'m just hypothesizing, and will leave the calculations to someone smarter than me. \\n I can see how the argument can be made that the jungle items don\\'t really provide any great stats for late game (Devourer being possible exception due to stacking damage), so once the mid or late game gets going and teamfights start rolling in earnest, a jungle item on the ADC wouldn\\'t be as helpful as more traditional items.  Of course, selling the item would nullify your smite upgrade.']\n",
