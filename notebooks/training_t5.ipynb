Do you know the hardest part about coming up with an elevator pitch? It’s trying to condense the most important parts into a concise number of words. That same difficulty can be found on Reddit, one of the fastest growing social media sites in the world. We’ve analyzed reddit data over a 10-year period and found that nearly 20% of all posts and articles had ineffective or erroneous titles. So, what’s the solution? Our product is a web-based app that takes a user’s post and generates a title that has been evaluated to accurately summarize the content. We're still in the early stages of development and would appreciate any feedback, would you be interested in meeting with my team to talk more through our product?\"]\n",
